**AWS-CI-CD-Project**
This project implements a fully automated CI/CD pipeline to streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying applications using AWS services. The pipeline is integrated with Bitbucket for source code management and deploys the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting.

![Project Architecture](./structure.png)


Project Workflow:

1.Bitbucket as Code Source:
The source code is managed in a Bitbucket repository.
Any changes pushed to the repository trigger the AWS CodePipeline, initiating the CI/CD process.

2.AWS CodePipeline:
Serves as the backbone of the CI/CD process.
Fetches the source code from Bitbucket, runs the build process using AWS CodeBuild, and deploys the final artifact to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

3.AWS CodeBuild:
Compiles the code, runs tests, and prepares the build artifacts for deployment.
It uses the buildspec.yml file in the repository to define the build instructions.

4.AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
Manages the deployment of the application.
Automatically provisions and scales infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances, load balancers) to host the application.

5.Scaling and Monitoring:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides automatic scaling based on traffic and integrated monitoring for performance and availability.



Prerequisites
To set up and use this CI/CD pipeline, ensure you have the following:

AWS Account with permissions to manage CodePipeline, CodeBuild, Elastic Beanstalk, and related services.
Bitbucket Repository containing the application’s source code.
A buildspec.yml file to define the build steps.
Elastic Beanstalk Application and an environment configured to deploy your application.
Setting Up the CI/CD Pipeline
Set Up a Bitbucket Repository

Push your application’s source code to a Bitbucket repository.
Configure AWS CodePipeline

Create a new pipeline using the AWS Management Console.
Set Bitbucket as the source stage and link it to your repository.
Create an AWS CodeBuild Project

Define a build project in AWS CodeBuild.
Include a buildspec.yml file in your repository to specify the build steps.
Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk

Configure Elastic Beanstalk as the deployment stage in AWS CodePipeline.
Make sure the build artifacts are compatible with your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

Benefits of the CI/CD Pipeline
Automation: Eliminates manual intervention in the deployment process, improving efficiency.
Scalability: Automatically scales applications using Elastic Beanstalk to handle varying traffic loads.
Reliability: Ensures consistent and error-free deployments with testing integrated into the build phase.
Integration: Provides seamless integration between Bitbucket and AWS services.
Future Enhancements
Introduce automated security scans during the build phase.
Implement a blue/green deployment strategy to reduce downtime during updates.
Add notification and alerting mechanisms for build or deployment failures.
Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities using AWS CloudWatch.
